# **Mortgage Calculator**

Warning! This is app is a learning exercise. It uses real loan logic, but made up currency!

## **Using:** 
Node.Js, Webpack 5 (with SASS, min-css-extract-plugin, html-webpack-plugin,Â devserver), SASS, React, Typescript, PopperJS  

### **Goal:**
Create a mortgage calculator with proper math behind calculations, different options that would affect calculations.
Practice styling complex form components, wire interdependency, complex conditional rendering, state management on multiple levels, debouncing input checking and updating state.  

### **Expected behavior:**
User can choose different types of mortgage, enter (or use range sliders) different values, check additional options to reduce loan interest value. And after some delay (to minimize rerenders) results should be calculated and shown. Additionally user can view payment schedule.  
### **Progress Log:**

#9. First iteration of Tooltip component for general use. Using PopperJS. There are some quirks to work out, though. Especially how to streamline content to a tooltip from various components.
#8. Refactored how formData is passed as props. Now formData is always named 'formData', any component specific data is 'data'.  
Results.rate sometimes loses precision (due to IEEF 754 float point standard), so it is rounded to 1 decimal digit.  
Fee could get wrong value when changing to mod with different minFee, now there is a check in the Mods component to prevent that and Inputs component local state is directly updated from globalForm data. This actually works even better in regards to data flow and visual representation, than previous structure.  
Input range is styled in chrome/edge now. And some other minor changes in styling.  
#7. First step to move all the calculations in a standalone module (schedule generation and results for now). useClickOutside is a custom hook now. Added quick scroll buttons, with some minor adjustments should be able make into a general use module.  
#6. Quick fix for Schedule calculations. Due to the small numbers and round to nearest integer accumulated rounding error proved to be to high to neglect. So now monthly payment, required income and nextLoandReminder are calculated and rounded to 2 decimal digits. This lead to a small update in thousandSeparator function which now takes in account a possibility of any decimal digits present. And some type changes for the schedule data.  
#5. Schedule can be view now. There are some quirks hiding about, though. Made first steps to styling desktop layout. Combed results jsx a bit.  
#4. Results calculating and rendering is implemented. Debouncing is done on Inputs component level and only for input values. That should be sufficient in my opinion. Some styling optimization. And fixed an issue with input fields state update. Now it is impossible to enter and save a value that is out of maximum bound.  
#3. Form logic is online. All components interactions with formData state are completely streamlined (check and prepare new values on a components local level -> pass to the top component update function as object of new values -> update formData in one go). Due to the strictness of input value checking Inputs component stores local state of all input values. Final value checking and formData state updating is debounced for 1 second. This way lets user enter any new positive number before it get checked and corrected if it is out of bounds (bounds set either in the input data or calculated from the price value).   
#2. Add data lists (initial Form data, options, mods and inputs).  
Add Form components with rudimentary logic for rendering inputs and corresponding range sliders, toggles and maternity/funds balancing. And required prop drilling for upcoming Form and Results state changing.
Add form elements stylings. Add some auxiliary functions for general use.  
#1. Add development environment, basic Layout and Initial style.  

### **TODO:**
- [x] Development env., basic layout, styles
- [x] Fill up default form and lists data
- [x] Create Form Component and its children, style up
- [x] Implement form logic
- [x] Fix maternity capital balancing 
- [x] Implement results debounce and calculation logic
- [x] Add payment schedule rendering
- [x] Add scroll to the top button for the schedule view
- [ ] Add tooltip component to streamline all tooltips visuals
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Refactor more
- [ ] And refactor some more!

### **Known Issues:**
1. Might be some quirks in maternity/funds balancing...
